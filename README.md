**Introduction**

Greetings, esteemed members of the Data Science Community, It is with great enthusiasm that I embark on a pivotal analysis journey focused on unravelling the intricate patterns within terrorism incidents. In this project, I am dedicated to employing advanced data analysis techniques to delve deep into this critical subject matter.
With the utilization of POWER BI, a powerful data visualization and analytics tool, I aim to not only analyze but also visualize the complex data associated with terrorism incidents. By harnessing the capabilities of POWER BI, I am confident in our ability to derive meaningful insights that can inform decision-making processes and contribute to a better understanding of this pressing global issue.
Throughout this endeavour, my objective is to showcase the effectiveness and versatility of POWER BI in handling large and diverse datasets. By creating intuitive dashboards and visualizations, I aspire to present the findings in a manner that is both comprehensive and accessible to stakeholders from various domains

**Primary Goal**

At the forefront of our mission is the strategic utilization of data-driven methodologies to enhance our comprehension of terrorism dynamics, and contribute to global security strategies.
Central to our endeavours is the relentless pursuit of insights derived from meticulous analysis of the “Global Terrorism Database”(GTD), an indispensable repository for discerning trends and patterns within terrorist activities.

**Aim**

Our objective is to conduct an exhaustive analysis augmented with visual representations, delving into the realm of terrorism incidents. Our aim is to unearth concealed trends and discernible patterns that underlie these occurrences. Through meticulous examination, we endeavour to elucidate the complexities that shape and impact such events, thereby contributing to a deeper understanding of this critical issue..

**About Data**

Information on more than 180,000 Terrorist Attacks
The Global Terrorism Database (GTD) is an open-source database including information on terrorist attacks around the world from 1970 through 2017. The GTD includes systematic data on domestic as well as international terrorist incidents that have occurred during this time period and now includes more than 180,000 attacks. The database is maintained by researchers at the National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism (START), headquartered at the University of Maryland.

**Content**

Geography: Worldwide

Time period: 1970-2017, except 1993

Unit of analysis: Attack

Variables: >100 variables on location, tactics, perpetrators, targets, and outcomes

Sources: Unclassified media articles (Note: Please interpret changes over time with caution. Global patterns are driven by diverse trends in particular regions, and data collection is influenced by fluctuations in access to media coverage over both time and place.)

**Definition of terrorism:**
"The threatened or actual use of illegal force and violence by a non-state actor to attain a political, economic, religious, or social goal through fear, coercion, or intimidation."
See the GTD Codebook for important details on data collection methodology, definitions, and coding schema.

**Methodology Recap and Setup**

Before we dive into the code, let's recap our methodology and set up the environment for our analysis. We'll also lay out the steps that will guide our exploration. Let's navigate through the following stages:

**Data Loading and Inspection:** We'll start by loading the "Global Terrorism Database" and conducting a quick overview of its structure to ensure we're working with the correct data.

**Data Preprocessing:** To prepare the data for analysis, we'll address missing values, and outliers, and convert relevant columns into appropriate formats.

**Data Visualization:** Visualizations play a pivotal role in uncovering insights. We'll create meaningful charts and graphs to visualize trends, patterns, and correlations within the dataset.

**Hypothesis Testing:** We use Hypothesis testing to confirm whether the observed patterns in the data are statistically significant or if they could have occurred by random chance. By performing hypothesis tests, we can determine if our findings are reliable and support our conclusions about the data.

**Getting Familiar With The Columns**

Year: This field contains the year in which the incident occurred.

Month This field contains the number of the month in which the incident occurred.

Country This field identifies the country or location where the incident occurred.

Region This field identifies the region in which the incident occurred.

City Name of the city, village, or town in which the incident occurred

Success:  Success of a terrorist strike

Attack_Type The general method of attack and broad class of tactics used.

Target_Type The general type of target/victim

Attack_Group The name of the group that carried out the attack

Weapon General type of weapon used in the incident

Number_of_Killed The number of total confirmed fatalities for the incident

Number_of_Hostage: Indicates if hostages were taken.

Ransom_Demand: Amount of ransom demanded.

Ransom_Paid: Amount of ransom paid.

Number_of_Wounded: Number of reported wounded.
